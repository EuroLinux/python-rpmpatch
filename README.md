# Python RPM AutoPatch

This project was originaly developed by Scientific Linux Developers

## Overview 
Basically this is a toolset for doing automated customization of a given rpm.

The idea is to keep it simple and easy to back up, while also making it simple
to track what changed and reproduce the changes from the source archive.

The patchsrpm.py script will provide a sample of how to use these libraries. It
also provides instructions on how to build a configuration file to begin
working with this toolset right away.
